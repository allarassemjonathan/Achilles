# Achilles

Achilles is a learning algorithm using supervised learning to guess the language of the text given by the user.
It uses bigrams to build a diagram of probabilities of getting certain combinations of characters depending on the language.
The dataset of books is freely provided by https://www.gutenberg.org/. 
So the algorithm just has to go through the books and figure out what will be the probability of having such and such bigrams in french, spanish, english or german. 
The more dataset you give to the algorithm the better it will get.
